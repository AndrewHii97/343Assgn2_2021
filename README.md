# INTERACTIVE TEXTURE MAPPING
## Introdution

You have learned several techniques of **shading and lightings** as well as **texture mapping** using **WebGL**. To understand further, you are required to **draw three 3d objects (sphere and   3D cube) with necessary buttons or sliders to control the rotations animations of the 3d objects with the necessary control of lightings and appropriate shadings.** You are also required to build **three simple texture images (e.g. your face, scenery, etc) that is to be mapped on to all three 3d objects respectively.**

## Objectives:
- To familiarise yourself with programming to build a simple 3D object with shading and lighting.

- To introduce you to the programming of texture mapping.

- To help you to understand further the concept of 3D computer graphics.

## Specifications:

You have to refer to Angel Section 7.5 (7th Edition). You are to run and then extend the program given in Angelâ€™s Website (see the URL below and also appended) as much as possible as specified below

[Texture Cube 2 Sample Code](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SEVENTH_EDITION/CODE/07/textureCubev2.html)

Based on the given program, you are to write a program to create a simple animation of rotation for all 3D objects in a single canvas Among the things that you have to perform include:

1. The 3D objects must be on the same canvas and can be controlled individually by using sliders or buttons. The animation should be rotated at 360 degrees. Your The 3D object must be mapped using your own texture image. The lightings and shadings should to be controlled using either buttons or sliders.

2. Your program must include the following elements:

  - Callback function: idle, reshape, mouse, keyboard.
  - Double buffering 
  - Interaction Buttons / Sliders
  - Animation
  - Texture Mapping

3. Design your own texture image to be mapped to each 3D object.

4. Write a structured program with good style and extend the functionalities of your program.

## Grading:

Grading is done based on the specifications above and extra credits will be given to those who have attempted other features of WebGL programming

## Deadline and method of submission:

Submit the **softcopy and object file (HTML and javascript)** of your program showing the capabilities of your program. **Good documentation in your program listings** is required and you should include a **one-page description** of what you have achieved with regard to the specification and the extra elements that you have included in your program.

This assignment must be submitted on **Monday (25 January 2021 at 5.00-6.00 pm)**
